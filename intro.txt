EVERYTHING IN JS HAPPENS INSIDE THE EXECUTION CONTEXT

--> JS is a SYNCHRONOUS SINGLE -THREADED language

IN JS :- FIRST THE WHOLE CODE IS READ LINE BY LINE AND MEMORY IS ALLOTED TO THEM LIKE :-
FOR VARIABLE = UNDEFINED
FOR FUNCTION = THE COMPLETE CODE INSIDE THE FUNCTION

After alocation it reads it again and assign the values in the execution context 
for exam var n = 3;
so first a memory will be allocated as n which will be undefined after complete allocation the n will be defined by 3
